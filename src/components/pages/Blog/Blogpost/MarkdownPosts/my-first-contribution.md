# My First Contribution to the **Open-Source Community**

Some Background: I'm about to start my forth year of Electrical Engineering. I have spent the last year, working in a newly created dev division of a company.

Why am I telling you this?

Well, you might be in a similar position where school has yes to teach you what it takes to be a full-stack developer. Unless you have done placements in software dev companies you most likely struggle to write proper code, know what the conventions are, understand deploy processes, build adequate unit testing methods, know how to use git on a large scale, etc.

I strongly believe (and I know I not the only to think this) that the best way to understand what it means to be part of a large-scale software dev team is to contribute to open-source projects.

This post is not a "How to" or a "steps to follow", I cannot preach what I do not know. I am simply documenting and explaining the process I was through in the hopes of helping others navigate this large sea that is the **open-source**.

### What it means to contribute to an open-source project

Contributing to a project will not only augment your coding capabilities and tighten your practices, it will give you a good taste of what it means to work with a large network of people from around the world. Hackathons, coding camps or courses, are all great but none of these give you the team skills you develop from being part of a project.

"Open-source", what a great way to call it. Yes it literally means that contributors can come from anywhere but I think it is important to also point out that it is the most "open" community you will over find. Usually very inviting, the open-source community does not care who you are, what you look like, what you have done in the past, etc., all it cares about is whether you can write code that will contribute to the project. And, you don't even need to write code, most contributions are changes to documentation, which means all you need to do is understand code. How awesome is that. No interview process, no screening, just, pure, raw skills. :rocket:
