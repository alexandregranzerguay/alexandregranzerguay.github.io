# My First Contribution to the __Open-Source Community__

Some Background: I'm about to start my forth year of Electrical Engineering. I have spent the last year, working in a newly created dev division of a company.

Why am I telling you this?

Well, you might be in a similar position where school has yes to teach you what it takes to be a full-stack developer. Unless you have done placements in software dev companies you most likely struggle to write proper code, know what the conventions are, understand deploy processes, build adequate unit testing methods, know how to use git on a large scale, etc.

I strongly believe (and I know I not the only to think this) that the best way to understand what it means to be part of a large-scale software dev team is to contribute to open-source projects.

This post is not a "How to" or a "steps to follow", I cannot preach what I do not know. I am simply documenting and explaining the process I was through in the hopes of helping others navigate this large sea that is the __open-source__.

### What it means to contribute to an open-source project

Contributing to a project will not only augment your coding capabilities and tighten your practices, it will give you a good taste of what it means to work with a large network of people from around the world. Hackathons, coding camps or courses, are all great but none of these give you the team skills you develop from being part of a project.

"Open-source", what a great way to call it. Yes it literally means that contributors can come from anywhere but I think it is important to also point out that it is the most "open" community you will over find. Usually very inviting, the open-source community does not care who you are, what you look like, what you have done in the past, etc., all it cares about is whether you can write code that will contribute to the project. And, you don't even need to write code, most contributions are changes to documentation, which means all you need to do is understand code. How awesome is that. No interview process, no screening, just, pure, raw skills.

__So let's get to it!__

### My process

**This is where is didn't make it easy for myself**

I started by reading these awesome guides!<br>
- [How-To-Contribute(Concept)](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [How-To-Contribute(Process)](https://github.com/Roshanjossey/first-contributions/blob/master/README.md)
- [Example within a project](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/wiki/A-step-by-step-guide-on-preparing-and-submitting-a-pull-request)

I was so ready to get to work and remembered a project I was curious about in the past [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft)

__For the curious: PySyft is a python tool that allows you to run machine learning/deep learning models in a decentralized manner. A very interesting project with a great community__

Now! I had never actually used PySyft. Don't get me wrong, I had used packages like Torch, TensorFlow, etc., but never got around to getting my hands dirty with this package.<br>

This was my mistake. It took more time trying to understand what methods/functions were used for then it did to actually write the code I was going to add into this project. 

I cannot stress this enough **Start with software you have already used**. It is much easier to get started.

To counter the position I had put myself in, I decided my first pull request (PR) would be docstring! Now, that was a good move. If your first commit is documentation of any kind, this will help you get a good understanding of the code and its functionality. This way, you can jump into harder issues with much more confidence.

Now it was time to execute the good old __Fork -> Clone -> Branch -> Merge -> PR__ proceedure. If the three articles weren't clear enough, this is what is happening. 

- Fork: copy the current state of the repo into your account. __Remember to add the original repo location as upstream__
- Clone: Get a local copy of the remote repo from your account.
- Branch: Never make changes to a master branch, even if it's your own and you are the only one making changes.
- Merge: Merge all your changes into your master branch
- PR: Submit a Pull Request. __Remember to follow convention of the project when doing so__

CONGRATS! You just submitted your first contribution to a project.

### Suggestions/Take away
Honestly, the biggest take away is to work on a project you are already using.
Other than that, have fun with this. Communicate as much as you can with you team, get to know them, they are there to help!
